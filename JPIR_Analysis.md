## 360 PDA Correlations

##### The 360 PDA is an inventory of person-descriptive adjectives that included Goldbergâ€™s (1992) 100 unipolar Big-Five factor markers, plus terms from each of the item clusters that have been hypothesized as potentially beyond the Big Five (Saucier & Goldberg, 1998).

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360 PDA markers in all lower case.
