## 360 amd 525 PDA Correlations.

#### This analysis aligns well-documented cybersecurity behavioral traits to the 15 measures in the JPI-R. These relationships aim to identify dimensions where high scores may suggest a propensity for cybersecurity roles.

###### The 360 PDA is an inventory of person-descriptive adjectives that included Goldberg’s (1992) 100 unipolar Big-Five factor markers, plus terms from each of the item clusters that have been hypothesized as potentially beyond the Big Five (Saucier & Goldberg, 1998).

###### The 525-PDA, a set of the 500 most familiar English person-descriptive adjectives (Saucier, 1997), plus the terms from Saucier’s (1994) 40-item Big-Five “Mini-Markers” that were not already included.

## JPI-R Cluster 1: Analytical

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions for “Analytical” in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360/525 PDA markers in all lower case.

###### This data is filtered for only Males in the Age Range of 20 - 49.

##### Results:

  - INNOVATIVE has strong corrleation to the cyberseucrity performance
    traits of: creative, immaginative, curious, innovative/

## JPI-R Cluster 2: Emotional

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions for “Emotional” in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360/525 PDA markers in all lower case.

##### Results:

  - None to note.

## JPI-R Cluster 3: Extroverted

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions for “Extroverted” in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360/525 PDA markers in all lower case.

##### Results:

  - ENERGY has strong correlation wtih the cybersecurity performance
    traits of energetic, active, and vigorous.
  - SOCIAL / SOCIAL CONFIDENCE has a strong corrleation with social and
    extraverted and a strong negative correlation with introverted;
    cybersecurity professionals report generally low sociability and
    high introversions.

## JPI-R Cluster 4: Opportunistic

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions for “Opportunistic” in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360/525 PDA markers in all lower case.

![](JPIR_Analysis_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Results:

  - RISK has moderate correlation wtih the cybersecurity performance
    traits of daring, independent, and competitive.

## JPI-R Cluster 5: Dependable

##### This shows the JPI-R Dimensions for “Dependable” in ALL CAPS and a selection of the 360 PDA markers in all lower case.

##### Results:

  - ORGANIZATION has moderate/strong correlation wtih the cybersecurity
    performance traits of organization, efficiency, perfection.
  - RESPONSIBLE has strong correlation with the trait of honesty,
    conventional and strait.
